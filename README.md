# About Me:
I'm a C/C++ developer with a love of data. Particularly, I'm very interested in data science and data engineering. My background in epidemiology gave me experience in statistics and mathematical modeling. <br><br Skills & Interests<br>C/C++ Developer â€“ As my introduction to programming was in learning C, I have a special fondness for this language. It gave me a strong understanding of pointers, memory management and data structures and algorithms.<br>Data Science & Engineering â€“ this is a new learning area for me. I've done exactly one (1) data engineering project, but it taught me a lot.
Mathematical Modeling â€“ All related to epidemiology. Specifically, vaccine modelling using Berkeley-Madonna software.<br>Epidemiology â€“ Using data to answer public health questions and suggest practical solutions to real problems<br><br>ðŸ”­ What I'm Working on<br>Expanding my C++ and data engineering expertise<br><br> Completing a data engineering project for DataTribe's data course<br> I have a brand new interest in **spatial epidemiology** and am currently studying more about this important subject<br><br> 

##  Some projects:
1. [Data engineering Capstone project](https://github.com/natalie-mein/data-engineering-learnings) : My first attempt at a data engineering project.
   This was in conjuction with [DataTribe Collective](https://github.com/datatribe-collective) and DataCamp and I won a 1 year scholarship to DataCamp.
2. [Minishell](https://github.com/natalie-mein/Minishell) A basic Unix shell (POSIX-C) -  a lightweight Unix-compatible shell that supports command execution, pipes, redirections, and built-in commands, emulating core shell functionalities.
3. [LIBFT](https://github.com/natalie-mein/libft)  A custom C standard library. I recreated essential functions from the C standard library and expanding it with custom functions for string handling, memory operations, list manipulation, and error checking.
